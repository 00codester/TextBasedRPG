# Overview

This is my first program using the Java language. It is a simple text-based RPG that allows the player to explore a castle looking for skills to be able to defeat the dragon boss. It uses variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, and arraylists to reinforce my programming knowledge and expand my confort with the Java language. 

This project was made to help me learn Java as well as basic game design.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
